List -->ArrayList ,LinkedList
Set -->HashSet,LinkedHashSet,TreeSet ( sorted Set)
Map-->Hashmap,TreeMap,ConcurenacehashMap( Bucket level Lock) 

HashSet: If you donâ€™t want to maintain insertion order but want to store unique objects. 
LinkedHashSet: If you want to maintain the insertion order of elements then you can use LinkedHashSet. 
TreeSet: If you want to sort the elements according to some Comparator then use TreeSet.

TreeMap is an example of a SortedMap, which means that the order of the keys can be sorted, and when iterating over the keys, you can expect that they will be in order.

HashMap on the other hand, makes no such guarantee. Therefore, when iterating over the keys of a HashMap, you can't be sure what order they will be in.

HashMap will be more efficient in general, so use it whenever you don't care about the order of the keys.
